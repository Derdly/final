  <p>What is art? Is it a painting or a picture? Is it that drawing your parents hung on the fridge when you were young? Art is a very subjective thing. Who determines what counts as art? I argue that instead of one set, defined thing, art is something from within. Art is a creation, an expression, something that varies from one person to another. Art is something which by its very nature cannot be defined, so why then is it that we often are paralyzed when trying to create it? It’s not an uncommon occurrence for people to simply not make art because they believe it won’t be good. However, much like defining art itself, defining “good” art is a difficult task. I believe there is no such thing as good art, there is simply art. If we allow ourselves to think of art as the act of simply creating something, then we will always create good art.

Whether or not a certain piece of art is perceived as good or not, its existence Is valid. Someone will find value in it, even if it’s creator does not. While the previously mentioned drawing on the fridge may not be seen as good art by many, it is seen that way by someone: the parents. They see it for what it is, a piece of art. They see the growth it shows from their child, and they see the value of it being created by someone dear.

Art doesn’t have to be some big spectacle. It can just be that drawing on the fridge, but it will always be important to someone. So go out there and make something. That something doesn’t have to be something big or grand, just make something from your own creative heart.</p>
